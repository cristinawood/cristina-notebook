Accessibility and Design - November 27, 2017

- A11Y, shorter for twitter

How do we define? 
  - general: ease of access, assistive technology, sensory (visual, auditory, speech), motor
  - digital: raw formats (interoperability), availabilty across platforms and devices, usability 

Biases and Stereotypes
  - ableism
  - disabled does not equal broken
  - defined by the norm?
  - assistive vs. adaptive > biases with assistive technology
--> are we going for a consistency of experience?

Where it impacts the human experience: 
- public spaces:
  - accessibility = retrofit, biased toward design it fits on top off
  - government online is a kind of public space
  - online shopping
- citizen engagement
  - democracy via voting
  - participation in public activities, protests
  - employment, poor access can disengage from different activities
- social participation
  - slang, context, language etc.
- Plain language:
  - academic writing is not always accessible
  - construction of identities and credibility
  - assimilation and accommodation (Jean Piaget)

"Make the right thing to do, the easiest thing to do." 
- UX saying

Accessibility and Compliance Online
- Lenses to align: laws, rules and regulations, requirements, policies and standards, governance, transparence
- WCAG has 4 principles, perceivable, operable (no interaction that a user can't perform,) understandable, robust (content must be robust enough that it can be used across different platforms)
CASE STUDY
- Perceivable: improper use of colour; media not captioned; sense-bias on content
- Operable: no coherent structure to content; special scripting and/or plug-ins required to use/interact with content; pointing device required for interaction with content
- Understandable: non-plain language; intent of interactions is unclear; attention thieves 
- Robust: non-system agnostic - scripting required to access content?

Social Constuctions of Disability
- "Othering"
  - content vs. container
- Disabled to diff-abled
- Not every situation is appropriate for everyone - in context of what's possible at the time
- What is doing the disabling here?

Design bias towards people like us...

Wrapping Up:
- This is a **BIG** topic
- Impact on digital is not always direct
- It's about the human experience
- If we're all in it together, there is no "other." There is only us! 

Shawn on PressBooks, rest of class:
- good practice to let people know when you're working in a chapter
- ProfHacker:
  - Why and How to Make Your PDFs Searchable ex. of stuff on accessibility
  - WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool to evaluate pressbooks and websites. One of lots of different tools that are available to check out what's going on!
  - Can use right-click, then "Inspect" to see CSS and HTML.
