    - Me Too seems to be an exceptional case of a social movement where top-down and bottom-up have been combined

- What role does academia play in social media activists movements?
- What can we learn from these movements?
- What should relationship between scholars & social actors be like? 
- How can we ensure that all forms of knowledge are equally valued?
- ie. "democratization" of specialized knowledge
- Where does all of this leave academics?
- Link between legitimacy and likes
- erosion of roles as experts as experts over last 15 years. Truth Decay.
- increased agency as well

## Social Actors

- Authors
  - "actively sharing new content of starting a conversation"
- Commentators/Distributors
  - retweets, echo "other users' original thoughts"
- Trolls
  - clear intent, subjectivity and creativity, agitators
- Bots
  - intent = ambiguous, automated programs creating content
- Scholars
  - academia
- General Public
  - susceptible to influence, structured by class, race/ethnicity, other factors

## #TrumpShutdown
- discussions on who will engage with what, what narratives are at play, whose stories are valued.
