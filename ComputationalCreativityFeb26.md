## Computational Creativity

### Defining creativity:
- actually creating, production
- ISSUES: quality? subjectivity? pressure?
- expression through a medium
- approach to solving problems within constraints
  - non-obvious outputs
- surprise/experimentation
- innovation
- relating seemingly unrelable things
- imagination
- enjoyment
- work, challenging

| Computational Creativity | Issues/Observations |
| -------- | ------|
| - what is doing the creative legwork? | - quality |
| - creates greater access, someone who isn't artistic | - pressure |
| - enhancing human creativity/ability | - accessibility |
| - how much creativity is programmed? | - elitism |
| - about using computers to understand human creativity? | - credit |
|  | - values & tools |
|  | - stereotypes |
|  | - tools for human creativity? |
|  | - not breaking conventions? |
