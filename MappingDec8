Edits coming from CDN public service - bulk from one office. Who was this? 

Palladio:
- once you've got data properly inputted, under data tab could load up .csv with point data
- can have sized data, use that to scale the point
- underneath tiles, you can put hit "custom tiles"
- Master Plan: at Dow's Lake was a swamp filled with squatters, Southam bought it, gave it to Carleton College. Have university situated there, plan to have an ornamental pond
- st. john's map from github.com/xtina-r/daea/blob/gh-pages/index.html
--> this is a ready-baked platform! 
fundamentally powered by Leaflet (as is Palladio!)
Could fork this! 

Over the holidays:
- try to start a draft outline, key points, sources, starting points
- Hypothesis, annotate Pressbooks
- outline as bare minimum for everyone
