# Public Humanities

## How to define the *public(s)*?
- everyone
- stakeholders
- participants
- general population
- multiple
- community 
- **institutions** - as another subsector
- **critics** - as another subsector
- what is a public space?
  - tax-funded
  - accessible 
  - no barriers/fees
  - internet is a public good in that it was funded by defense funding, and also in the sense that it was a commons that has become increasingly blocked off. 
  
## What comes to mind when discussing the *public humanities*?
- critique/lens
- engage in discourse 
- collaborative
- patience: archaeologists engaging with pseudo-archaeologists on Twitter, ties into generous thinking (trying to assume the best in what was happening in the dialogue. 
- connect with "non-expert" users
- different bases of knowledge

## Key Components of Existing Definitions
- Public humanities is
  - the work of _federal, state, nonprofit and community-based cultural organizations;_
  - programs engage everyone in reflecting on diverse heritage, traditions, and history, and their relevance of the humanities to the current conditions of life.

## How does this relate to our overall discussion of the digital humanities?
- in digital setting:
  - new communities, new ways of interacting with one another
  - access to information 
  - information overload
  - copyright issues still
  - credibility difficult to identify
  - less permanence
  - consensus-based? who shouts the loudest?
  - knowledge by headline?
  - is objectivity lost?
- in traditional setting:
  - barriers to reach audience
  - scarcity 
  - copyright issues! 
  - credibility by familiarity
  - offload vetting
  - profit?

## Public Scholarly Discussions

### Challenges of public scholarly discussions
- expectation from institutions
- opposition can threaten career prospects
  - risk-averse organizations, especially as they are corporatizing
  - outrage machine
- challenging unpopular/popular ideas
- values? whose?
  - disagree without being disagreeable
  - do research/inform on ongoing discussions
  - has to be generous intent, see sea-lioning
  - reflect democratic ideals
  - connected to civic duty
  - book on **Bowling Alone** about collapse of American civil society
- systems are built on a certain worldview, libertarian, completely open, free-to-speak
### Opportunities of public scholarly discussions
- exposure for new, emerging scholars
- challenge ideas
- critical thinking
- diversity of voices (but that's incumbent on individual people - flip-side there) ex. like Blue-Feed, Red-Feed by the NYT

## Personal Attacks & Trolls
Animosity on the internet is not a new concept, this week we explored a number of articles chronicling negative reactions to publicly released projects and thought. These examples highlight different prejudices and forms of harassment enabled by engaging the public in discourse. 
It may not be safe for everyone to participate actively or openly in the current online environment. **How can this be mitigated? Should we discourage this kind of discussion online?**
- Tressie McMillan Cottom resisting the trolls by turning them into data
- turning off comments, blocking Hypothesis, if people want to comment on work, must write on their own platform and link back
- look into Motherboard on algorithms, people behind the algorithms 
- resistance has to be guerilla, activist, should we just burn it all down?

## Public Perception & Education
In the articles this week about Sarah Bond's experience, in addition to the personal attacks that she experienced, the issue of public perception and changing a narrative around certain humanities disciplines is also discussed. 
What role can the digital humanities take in informing cultural sector productions and education to accurately portray history and human civilizations?
Is the creation of these works a piece of public humanities, in that it engages the public with aspects of the discipline?
- classics as a discipline so entwined with fascism, Mussolini, white supremacy. Bond's issues with the history of the tradition
- in the art of stroytelling, how much responsibility does the author/creator have in creating something accurate? Can the audience differentiate? What did they get right? What did they get wrong? Does it matter?
  - running the risk of people getting their backs up. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

## Intellectual Property & Ownership
Who owns the intellectual property derived from public conversations? Who funds the underlying work product?
In order to continue an academic career, is there an expectation to foster an online brand? Why?
How does the pressure to engage the public in activities impact what is being studied and the methods for these studies? What impact does this have on projects?
- reclaim hosting.com good for academics
- individual vs. collective

## Concluding thoughts
- digital humanities do not always have to be public humanities
- up to you to figure out what choices you make, what degrees you're comfortable with 
- sketchfab.com, search british museum, high definition 3-D models annotated with academic information. This liberates the artifacts in a way.
