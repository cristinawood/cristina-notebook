## Publishing in the Digital Era

What does it mean to publish? Questions of authorship?

### Publishing defined:
- focus on print, internet/digital is an afterthought! 
- filter then publish, publish then filter, 
- spectrum of publishing
- authenicity - who has it?

### Creative Commons Licenses 
- list of CC's with different rules
- non-commercial uses! 

### Anxieties
- fake news, authority etc. 

### Middle Ground Journal
- incorporating high school students
- capitalist nature of publishing/academia, doesn't necessarily have to be this way!
- University Presses could transform their structures 
- reputation economy that makes for some obscure economics

### SHERPA/RoMeo
- rights, what you're getting into as you publish
- archiving/open-access repositories
- academia.edu - is not a repository of value, they close-off access

### Escaping the Confines of the Page
- word processing helps us to have more control over authorship, have writing become much more about the process - more recursive, more nonlinear, more open-ended, more spontaneous - than my previous technologies permitted." - Kathleen Fitzpatrick
- incentives in reputation system, intersect with tenure system
  - perverse incentives in this whole thing! Hard to disentangle these! 
  - what would a reader-focused publishing system look like?
- data publishing was also brought to the fore:
  - what does that look like?
  - pushback on this, even raw or cooked data!
  - scarcity focus when they came of age academically! 

### The Age of the Post-Author
- opus of online annotations as a kind of publishing! 
- more active-reading! "displacement of a hermeneutical model of reading by one premised on absorption, the transformation of copyright into contract: all point toward the subsuming fear of a loss of community..." - Kathleen Fitzpatrick, *Planned Obsolescence*
